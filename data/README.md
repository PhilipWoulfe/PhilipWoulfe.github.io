# F1 Competition Rules

## Main Competition Rules

1. Pre-Season Questions Bonus is applied to a players total race points after Abu Dhabi GP. 

2. Answers to the Pre Season Questions will be determined by the admins ( David and Steven ) based on the results of each race, these will be shared before we apply the bonus points to ensure consensus. 

3. Each players race selection should be provided no later than 30 minutes before the scheduled start time of each race, if not provided, the players selection from the previous race will be applied. If not provided for the first race, drivers that qualify in 4th, 5th and 6th will be used as podium selection and 1st position will be used as DNF selection. All players selections will be shared before the start of each race. 

    3a: Earlier submission of race selections may be required where the race start time in UTC is deemed "Too early for this craic". Players will be notified prior to GP qualification if this rule applies. 

4. Results will be based on the finishing position of drivers at the end of each race, however, if final results are later revised by FIA due to DSQ, Penalty etc, Results will be updated to match the new finishing positions.

5. In the event a race is cancelled, there will be no points distributed for that weekend.

6. If two or more players are tied for any of the prize awarding positions in the leaderboard, the FIA countback procedure will be completed to compare each players results over the entire season to determine the final finishing position of each player. If still even after countback, prize will be split.

7. Players selections for each race should be in the format "1st, 2nd, 3rd, DNF" e.g. "PIA, VER, HAM, RUS", other variations, including either a drivers full name, first name, surname are acceptable, provided it uniquely identifies that driver and it is clear what classification the player intended. "None" is also a valid selection for DNF and is awarded the same points as a correct DNF if no driver is classified as DNF.

8. There may be stewards randomly assigned from the pool of players for each race to answer any further questions pertaining to that race.

9. In the event of the untimely demise of any of the players, while unfortunate, of course, their entry fee is considered forfeit to the competition prize fund and shall not be redeemed by any beneficiaries. Their finishing position in the competition is also forfeit and those players who scored less but who had the good manners not to demise themselves, move up a position.
